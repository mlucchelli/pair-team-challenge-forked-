# Ruby on Rails challenge

You're working for a healthcare startup that is building a platform to facilitate communication between doctors and their patients. A key feature of the system is the ability for doctors to place calls to patients.
A third-party telephony service, similar to Twilio, is available to handle the actual placing of calls. You donâ€™t need to implement the telephony functionality yourself but should make use of this service in your API.

### Problem Statement

You need to design and implement a RESTful API for handling the following use cases:

1. **Initiate a call immediately:** A doctor should be able to initiate a call with a patient on demand.
1. **End ongoing call:** A doctor should be able to stop the ongoing call anytime.
1. **Fetch patient call history:** Retrieve a log of all the calls made between a doctor and a patient.

And receive data from a webhook  
**Update call details:** the 3rd party provider will send a call summary which includes the duration and transcript.

The webhook request contains the following body

```json
{
  "event_type": "call_update",
  "call_id": "6ba3d52e-48b9-4900-845e-edd965109e86",
  "status": "completed",
  "duration": 123,
  "transcript": [
    "Hey there!",
    "Hi!"
  ],
  ...
}
```
